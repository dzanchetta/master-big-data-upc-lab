# Master in Big Data Management, Analytics and Technologies
This repository has been created to manage the deliverables of the master course, at UPC.
It currently consists of:
## Hadoop
Holds the materials delivered for the Hadoop sessions, such as HDFS, HBase, and so on.

## Data Analytics
Holds the materials delivered for the statistics classes, mostly in R code (Rmd files).

## Others (in the future...)
While we make progress with the course, more sections are going to be created to organize the content.
